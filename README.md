# DiscordBot9000
## A fun Discord bot written in Python
###### Does not work with Python 3.7, recommended Python 3.6
## Instructions
1. Get a bot token from discordapp.com/developers/applications.  
2. Paste that token into the first line of a file called "token.txt".  
3. Place the file in the same directory as the script bot.py.  
4. Run bot.py in Python older than 3.7.  

When running in Discord users can use commands prefaced with a $ such as saying "$github".  A help command to list all commands will likely be added in the near future.
