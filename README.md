## This no longer works with how python and discord bots have changed.
## A fun Discord bot written in Python
## Instructions
1. Get a bot token from discordapp.com/developers/applications.  
2. Paste that token into the first line of a file called "token.txt".  
3. Place the file in the same directory as the script bot.py.  
4. Run bot.py in Python newer than 3.5. 

When running in Discord users can use commands prefaced with a $ such as saying "$github".
